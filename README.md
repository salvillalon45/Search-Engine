# Search-Engine
[Personal Project] - Project: Search Engine

This was one of the projects from the class I took this past Fall Quarter 2018. The class was called CS 121: Information Retrieval which is an introduction to
information retrieval including indexing, retrieval, classifying, and clustering text and multimedia documents.</p>

# About the Project
This project consisted of three:
- Josh Dela Cruz [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joshuadelacruz1/) | [Personal Website](http://delacruz1.github.io/)
- Jocelyn Flores
- Salvador Villalon [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/salvadorvillalon) | [Personal Website](http://salvillalon45.github.io/
       
# The project consisted of three components to complete

## Component 1: Create an Inverted Index
- We created an inverted index based on the corpus given to us. The corpus consisted of pages from the Information & Computer Sciences Domain. The given corpus included 37, 497 URLS organized into 75 folders each folder had 500 files where each file had HTML content. We decided to use MongoDB to store our inverted index

## Component 2: Search and Retrieve
- Once we created the inverted index, we need to prompt the user for a query where the program will look up the index, perform som calculations and give out the ranked list of pages that are relevant for the query
- There was extra credit for this project. To get extra credit we needed to make graphical user interface or web interface for it. We were not able to complete it, but this Win7ter 2018 break I decided to continue the project by creating a Web Application for it </li>
   
## Component 3: Ranking
- At the very least, the ranking formula should include Tf-Idf scoring to help with the query results ranking
- There was extra credit if you had additional compenets to the formula. We decided to give additional weight to the tf-idf score if the query from user (this score only apply to queries with two terms and beyond) exactly appear.</li>

## Technologies Used
- HTML, CSS, Python, Flask, NLTK, Google App Engine, MongoDB
